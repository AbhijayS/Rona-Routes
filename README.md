# Rona Routes

## Hackday Weekend Goals
* Directions (mostly formatting the url based on the use request)
    * Switching bw car and walking
    * Drop downs for to and from fields
    * Populate journey time and time of arrival
* Rating
    * Calculate max/min ratings and base all other ratings based on that
    * Apply the simple algorithm to give a destination rating
    * API requests to data and GMaps
    * Populate the rating
* Heat map (optional)
    * Some clever visualization of the algorithm
    * Probably overlay on top of the map
    * Hard part is knowing where everything is on the map
